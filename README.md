# ⏳ gitlab-history-port

> Bringing my development history from GitLab into the GitHub universe — because years of work deserve to be visible.

## 💡 Motivation

For the past several years, I’ve primarily worked with **GitLab** as my source control platform. While GitLab served me well, GitHub has become the de facto portfolio for developers, recruiters, and open-source communities. Unfortunately, the GitHub contributions graph doesn’t reflect all the years I spent coding, committing, and building.

This repository exists as a **bridge between platforms** — a way to **import my GitLab commit history into GitHub** in a meaningful, transparent, and honest manner.

## 🎯 Purpose

- 📅 Recreate my GitLab commits (dates, messages, author info) as dummy commits on GitHub  
- 👤 Ensure commits are attributed correctly to my GitHub account  
- 🟩 Populate my contributions graph with **real** historical work — not noise, not fake activity  
- 📈 Provide context to anyone looking at my GitHub profile — this is the *missing piece*  

## 🧰 What's Inside?

This repo contains:
- Empty/dummy files committed with timestamps matching my original GitLab work
- Commit messages and authorship info preserved as closely as possible
- A clean and readable contribution history that reflects my actual activity

> Note: No sensitive code or business logic is included — only placeholder files and metadata.

## 🤔 Why not just start fresh?

Because my journey didn’t start on GitHub.  
I believe it’s worth showing the *full arc* — not just the highlight reel.

This isn't about gaming the system — it's about **owning my history** and **making my past visible** on the platform where future opportunities may find me.

## 🧾 Disclaimer

All commits here are symbolic placeholders representing real activity on GitLab.  
This repo is *not* meant to be functional software — it’s a **historical mirror**.
